a brief (one-sentence) description of how you chose to use JavaScript and Bootstrap.

JavaScript is used to manage interactivity within the project list. When users click a project name,
JavaScript functions toggle the visibility of the corresponding project description, enhancing navigation and user experience.

Bootstrap provides a responsive grid system, making the layout adaptable across different screen sizes.
Components such as accordion are used for collapsible sections, and utility classes like text-center and mt-4 ensure consistent spacing and alignment.
